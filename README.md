# MovieRecommender
 A recommender system that uses my implementation of the KNN algorithm.
 Dataset: 20 millions ratings provided by  Movielens dataset
 Based on genre,average ratings (content-based)
 
 The recommendation system is classified into two type Content-Based and Collaborative based recommendation system.
 My system is focused on content based.
 
 The idea behind Content-based (cognitive filtering) recommendation system is to recommend an item based on a comparison between the content of the items and a user profile.
 In simple words,I may get recommendation for a movie based on the description of other movies.
